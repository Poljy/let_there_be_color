# let_there_be_color

Project for the course "Introduction à l'Imagerie Numérique" (Y. Gousseau, J. Delon) of the Master MVA (2020-2021).

Our work for this project was to study, implement, train and test the method described in the paper "Let there be Color!: Joint End-to-end Learning of Global and Local Image Priors for Automatic Image Colorization with Simultaneous Classification". This paper presents an end-to-end colorization method for grayscale images.

See our report and presentation slides for more information and results.
